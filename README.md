# TournamentGameGenerator
Simple Tournament game generator


Utlizing classes, methods, lists, loops and if-else I created a simple tournament generator.

You will first need to ask the user of your program to input the number of teams; you may assume there will always be an even number of teams (you don't need to validate this). Next you will need to ask for the names of all of the teams and store them in some way.

After this you'll need to determine the number of games that were played by each team; you may assume each team plays the same number of games. Finally, you'll need to determine the number of wins each team had during the regular season.

When asking for user input, you'll need to make sure all input is valid and ask the user to try again if they give you invalid input. You may assume user input will always be the correct type (i.e. if you ask for a number you will always get an integer). You can determine if the input is invalid by looking at the following constraints:

There are always at least 2 teams in the tournament.
Each team plays every other team at least once in the regular season.
All team names contain at most 2 words and at least 2 characters.
Each team has at minimum 0 wins and no more wins than the number of games they played.
